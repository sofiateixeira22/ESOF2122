### Retrospective

#### What we Did Well

- By reusing the uni app code we simplified certain tasks such as restaurant fetching and UI's.
- We upgraded the project version to the most recent flutter version
- Completed features are well implemented and valuable to the client
- The communication between the group members was consistent and useful for decision making
#### What we should Do Different

- Some group members had some difficulties with flutter setup, which affected the number of issues completed.
- Because we assigned the issues too early, we felt restricted in the issues we could work on. Next iteration, we will try a different strategy, only assigning issues when someone moves them to the 'in progress' column.

#### Puzzles

- The uni app code general structure was very challenging to understand.
- We are still very puzzled about the usage of local storage and the future use of backend.

### Retrospective

#### What we Did Well

- We managed to divide tasks well between the members of our group, allowing each member to experiment with the technologies in use for this project.
- The code we developped was the result of a good team effort. Every time a member had a doubt, we would communicate with each other and eventually find the solution in a faster way that if that problem was solved by that member alone.
  
#### What we should Do Different

- In this two weeks, we had some trouble managing our time to work in this project. We hope that we can perform better at this front in the last iteration.

#### Puzzles

- Understanding how to implement the google maps api was quite difficult and time consuming. Because of that we think we should think of a different way to access the path to a restaurant.

### Retrospective

#### What we Did Well

- We were able to divide the tasks well as a group, making use of the Board in GitHub projects. We noticed that, as we adapted to this way of developing code, i.e. having a list of tasks and assigning someone to them only when that someone was availiable to complete the task, the flow of work has improved because we could know for sure what each member was doing and what was the progess of the general product.  

- The group worked well as a team maintaining communication with each other and updating the group when a new feature was added or a bug was found. This led to the team to fix any bug or minor error faster with the help of everyone envolved on this project.
  
#### What we should Do Different

- Because this Iteration was in the last weeks of classes, we weren't able to manage our time to work in this project as well as we wanted to. We hope that this experience will allow us to try to improve this subject on future projects.

#### Puzzles

- We had some doubts on what was the best way to save search history, we are still trying to figure that out.
- Unit and acceptance tests.
