### Retrospective

#### What we Did Well

- By reusing the uni app code we simplified certain tasks such as restaurant fetching and UI's.
- We upgraded the project version to the most recent flutter version
- Completed features are well implemented and valuable to the client
- The communication between the group members was consistent and useful for decision making
#### What we should Do Different

- Some group members had some difficulties with flutter setup, which affected the number of issues completed.
- Because we assigned the issues too early, we felt restricted in the issues we could work on. Next iteration, we will try a different strategy, only assigning issues when someone moves them to the 'in progress' column.

#### Puzzles

- The uni app code general structure was very challenging to understand.
- We are still very puzzled about the usage of local storage and the future use of backend.
