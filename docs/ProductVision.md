# Product Vision

## Vision Statement

**UniEats** is a find-my-meal app that aims to list places to eat close to UP, and their menus, ordering them by relative distance to help the academic community know all their options. This app would also include a shortcut to Google Maps to show the way there.
Unlike sigarra, our product would provide an easy way to find menus of different places, much more complete and in a faster way. 

## Main Features

- Restaurant Login - We provide account creation and login for restaurants without online menus, in order for them to add their options to our app.
- Google Maps Link - Add information of the shortest path to the place selected
- Add Menus - To keep the information of the menus updated.
- Academic Login - Saves previous searches (history) and a list of favorite places.
- Search Bar - Allows to search for a specific restaurant/canteen and get information about the place.
- Search Filters - Filters the search for restaurants/canteens to search type of food (fast-food, traditional, vegan...), maximum distance to the local, price range, etc. 
- Sorting search results - Order the results of a specific search by price, distance, etc.
- Restaurant/Canteen Page - Information about capacity, distance to current location, average price, integration with Google Maps to help with picking, reviews of previous customers 
- Add Review - Authenticated users can add reviews to restaurants and canteens they already tried, in order to provide even more information to other users in time of decision.
- "Random Selection" Button - Choose maximum distance/price and get a recomendation
